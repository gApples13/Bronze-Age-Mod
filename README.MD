# Project On Hold
After working on this mod for a couple days and making minimal progress, I've realized that I really don't
know what I'm doing.

The Bronze Age mod will be put on hiatus until I've worked up some more skills writing 
Java. A release will not be published until then.

You're welcome to try and compile this into bytecode yourself and try it out. Just know it's
_very_ unfinished.

# The Bronze Age
A.K.A "Awesomer Copper", Bronze is a metal alloy of copper and tin.
This mod for forge 1.18.2 makes copper a little less useless.

## What does it add?
_The Bronze Age_ adds tin. Tin is useless on it's own, but when you make an alloy with copper, you get bronze. 
Stronger than Iron, weaker than diamond.

With bronze, you can make:

### Tools
- Bronze Pickaxe
- Bronze Sword
- Bronze Axe
- Bronze Hoe
- Bronze Shovel
- Bronze Hammer
	- Used to smash stone, much like in Ex Nilo hammers.
- Bronze Reinforced Bow

### Armor
- Basic Armor Set (Helmet, Chestplate, Leggings, Boots)
- Bronze Reinforced Shield

- More Planned For Future Versions

## Q/A
Q: Is there a fabric version?  
A: Not yet, I plan to make one though.

Q: What is forge?  
A: The framework this mod is made with. To use it in your game, you need to install the forge mod loader.
Download it here [https://files.minecraftforge.net]

Q: I can't find the jar file!  
A: There is no jar file, a release has not been published yet.

Q: The mod is broken, where can I report problems?  
A: The GitHub issues tab. Remember, start your own thread. Don't hijack other people's thread with "I have the same problem." Everyone hates that.

Q: Are there more doors or wheels in the world?  
A: Neither exist. There are only particles in the shape of doors and wheels. But how do we define those shapes? Please do not
ask me about ontology again.

Q: What will you be doing while the mod is on hold?  
A: I'll be working on learning Java. As it would seem, I was a victim of 
[The Dunning-Kruger Effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
I thought I knew enough java to make a mod. I did not. So, I'll be learning until then.
