# The Bronze Age
A.K.A "Awesomer Copper", Bronze is a metal alloy of copper and tin.
This mod for forge 1.18.2 makes copper a little less useless.

# An update
1.18? You're funny, past me. Anyway, this mod hasn't been updated with anything in a while, I'll be putting this project officially on indefinite hiatus for a while. Minecraft mods are hard to make, and they take time and effort that I can't commit right now. Additionally, the modding community is moving on from forge and embracing fabric. So if i do ever remake this mod it will be ported to fab first. Anyway, it's almost midnight as I write this, good night.

## What does it add?
_The Bronze Age_ adds tin. Tin is useless on it's own, but when you make an alloy with copper, you get bronze.
Stronger than Iron, weaker than diamond.

With bronze, you can make:

### Tools
- Bronze Pickaxe
- Bronze Sword
- Bronze Axe
- Bronze Hoe
- Bronze Shovel
- Bronze Hammer
	- Used to smash stone, much like in Ex Nilo hammers.

- Bronze Reinforced Shield

- More Planned For Future Versions
