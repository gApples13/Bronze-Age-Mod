# The Bronze Age
A.K.A "Awesomer Copper", Bronze is a metal alloy of copper and tin.
This mod for forge 1.18.2 makes copper a little less useless.

## What does it add?
_The Bronze Age_ adds tin. Tin is useless on it's own, but when you make an alloy with copper, you get bronze.
Stronger than Iron, weaker than diamond.

Download it here [https://files.minecraftforge.net]

Q: I can't find the jar file!  
A: There is no jar file, a release has not been published yet.

Q: The mod is broken, where can I report problems?  
A: The GitHub issues tab. Remember, start your own thread. Don't hijack other people's thread with "I have the same problem." Everyone hates that.

Q: Are there more doors or wheels in the world?  
A: Neither exist. There are only particles in the shape of doors and wheels. But how do we define those shapes? Please do not
ask me about ontology again.
